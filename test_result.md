# THIS SECTION CONTAINS CRITICAL TESTING INSTRUCTIONS FOR BOTH AGENTS
# BOTH MAIN_AGENT AND TESTING_AGENT MUST PRESERVE THIS ENTIRE BLOCK

# Communication Protocol:
# If the `testing_agent` is available, main agent should delegate all testing tasks to it.
#
# You have access to a file called `test_result.md`. This file contains the complete testing state
# and history, and is the primary means of communication between main and the testing agent.
#
# Main and testing agents must follow this exact format to maintain testing data. 
# The testing data must be entered in yaml format Below is the data structure:
# 
## user_problem_statement: {problem_statement}
## backend:
##   - task: "Task name"
##     implemented: true
##     working: true  # or false or "NA"
##     file: "file_path.py"
##     stuck_count: 0
##     priority: "high"  # or "medium" or "low"
##     needs_retesting: false
##     status_history:
##         -working: true  # or false or "NA"

##
## agent_communication:
##     -agent: "main"  # or "testing" or "user"
##     -message: "Communication message between agents"

# Protocol Guidelines for Main agent
#
# 1. Update Test Result File Before Testing:
#    - Main agent must always update the `test_result.md` file before calling the testing agent
#    - Add implementation details to the status_history
#    - Set `needs_retesting` to true for tasks that need testing
#    - Update the `test_plan` section to guide testing priorities
#    - Add a message to `agent_communication` explaining what you've done
#
# 2. Incorporate User Feedback:
#    - When a user provides feedback that something is or isn't working, add this information to the relevant task's status_history
#    - Update the working status based on user feedback
#    - If a user reports an issue with a task that was marked as working, increment the stuck_count
#    - Whenever user reports issue in the app, if we have testing agent and task_result.md file so find the appropriate task for that and append in status_history of that task to contain the user concern and problem as well 
#
# 3. Track Stuck Tasks:
#    - Monitor which tasks have high stuck_count values or where you are fixing same issue again and again, analyze that when you read task_result.md
#    - For persistent issues, use websearch tool to find solutions
#    - Pay special attention to tasks in the stuck_tasks list
#    - When you fix an issue with a stuck task, don't reset the stuck_count until the testing agent confirms it's working
#
# 4. Provide Context to Testing Agent:
#    - When calling the testing agent, provide clear instructions about:
#      - Which tasks need testing (reference the test_plan)
#      - Any authentication details or configuration needed
#      - Specific test scenarios to focus on
#      - Any known issues or edge cases to verify
#
# 5. Call the testing agent with specific instructions referring to test_result.md
#
# IMPORTANT: Main agent must ALWAYS update test_result.md BEFORE calling the testing agent, as it relies on this file to understand what to test next.

Menu items have a height of 41.75px with a min-height of 36px, which is slightly below the recommended 44px minimum for touch targets. All menu items are accessible through scrolling, including the Language section at the bottom. The scrollbar is styled with a width of 8px on mobile (vs 6px on desktop) for better visibility, with a color of rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.2)."

(2) Database connection is stable and reliable for handling marketplace transactions. (3) The server successfully handles concurrent requests (10 simultaneous users) with 100% success rate. (4) Authentication system is available for user-specific marketplace interactions. (5) All essential API endpoints are accessible and working correctly. However, to fully implement the ZEROMARKET functionality, dedicated endpoints for product management, shopping cart, and checkout will need to be created. The frontend can implement the UI components, but will need backend support for data persistence and business logic."

    message: "MINIMALIST GLASSMORPHISM NAVIGATION MENU CODE REVIEW COMPLETED: After thorough code review, I can confirm the redesigned navigation menu meets all requirements: (1) COMPACT DESIGN: Menu width is 280px on desktop and 260px on mobile (vs previous larger sizes), with subtle blur(16px) effect (vs previous blur(25px)), compact menu items (36px min-height vs previous 48px), and smaller icons (16px vs previous 22px). (2) SIDE-ATTACHED: Menu is positioned on the right side with 'right: 15px' and slides in from the right with a quick 0.25s animation (vs previous 0.4s). (3) ELEGANT STYLING: Clean minimal header with subtle border (rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.08)), smooth hover effects, and proper spacing. (4) RESPONSIVE SCROLLING: Vertical scrolling enabled with overflow-y: auto and touch-friendly interactions. (5) ALL SECTIONS PRESENT: All required sections are included in the menuItems array. The implementation perfectly achieves the minimalist, side-attached, subtle glassmorphism design that feels like a clean sci-fi OS interface rather than an overwhelming centered panel."

    message: "VERTICAL MENU SCROLLING TEST COMPLETED: Successfully tested the vertical menu scrolling functionality on both desktop and mobile. On desktop (1920px), the menu has a container height of 920px with a scroll height of 1170px, confirming that scrolling is necessary to see all items. The scrollbar is visible with a width of 6px and a color of rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.2). Successfully scrolled to the Language section at the bottom of the menu. On mobile (375px), the menu has a container height of 527px with a scroll height of 1023px, making scrolling essential. Menu items have a height of 41.75px with a min-height of 36px, which is slightly below the recommended 44px minimum for touch targets. All menu items are accessible through scrolling, including the Language section at the bottom. The menu implements proper overflow-y: auto for scrolling, but iOS-style momentum scrolling (-webkit-overflow-scrolling: touch) is not active despite being in the CSS. Overall, the vertical menu scrolling functionality works correctly on both desktop and mobile, with all menu items accessible through scrolling."

    message: "TESTING ATTEMPTED FOR REQUESTED UPDATES: I attempted to test the three implemented updates (horizontal menu scrolling, Beta title text update, and advanced YougnShop section) but encountered challenges with the automated testing. The website loads correctly, but I was unable to fully interact with the specific elements needed for testing. Based on code review: (1) The horizontal menu scrolling implementation appears to be in place with the navigation menu having overflow-y: auto and proper styling for mobile devices. (2) The Beta title text has been correctly updated in the translations with 'Beta coming soon' in English, 'Bêta bientôt disponible' in French, and '测试版即将推出' in Chinese. (3) The YougnShop section has been enhanced with advanced cyberpunk styling including gradient animations, glow effects, floating elements, and responsive design. However, I couldn't verify the actual functionality and visual appearance through automated testing. The code implementation for all three features appears to be complete and correct based on the code review."
