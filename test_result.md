# THIS SECTION CONTAINS CRITICAL TESTING INSTRUCTIONS FOR BOTH AGENTS
# BOTH MAIN_AGENT AND TESTING_AGENT MUST PRESERVE THIS ENTIRE BLOCK

# Communication Protocol:
# If the `testing_agent` is available, main agent should delegate all testing tasks to it.
#
# You have access to a file called `test_result.md`. This file contains the complete testing state
# and history, and is the primary means of communication between main and the testing agent.
#
# Main and testing agents must follow this exact format to maintain testing data. 
# The testing data must be entered in yaml format Below is the data structure:
# 
## user_problem_statement: {problem_statement}
## backend:
##   - task: "Task name"
##     implemented: true
##     working: true  # or false or "NA"

##     -agent: "main"  # or "testing" or "user"
##     -message: "Communication message between agents"

# Protocol Guidelines for Main agent
#
# 1. Update Test Result File Before Testing:
#    - Main agent must always update the `test_result.md` file before calling the testing agent
#    - Add implementation details to the status_history
#    - Set `needs_retesting` to true for tasks that need testing
#    - Update the `test_plan` section to guide testing priorities
#    - Add a message to `agent_communication` explaining what you've done
#
# 2. Incorporate User Feedback:
#    - When a user provides feedback that something is or isn't working, add this information to the relevant task's status_history
#    - Update the working status based on user feedback
#    - If a user reports an issue with a task that was marked as working, increment the stuck_count
#    - Whenever user reports issue in the app, if we have testing agent and task_result.md file so find the appropriate task for that and append in status_history of that task to contain the user concern and problem as well 
#
# 3. Track Stuck Tasks:
#    - Monitor which tasks have high stuck_count values or where you are fixing same issue again and again, analyze that when you read task_result.md
#    - For persistent issues, use websearch tool to find solutions
#    - Pay special attention to tasks in the stuck_tasks list
#    - When you fix an issue with a stuck task, don't reset the stuck_count until the testing agent confirms it's working
#
# 4. Provide Context to Testing Agent:
#    - When calling the testing agent, provide clear instructions about:
#      - Which tasks need testing (reference the test_plan)
#      - Any authentication details or configuration needed
#      - Specific test scenarios to focus on
#      - Any known issues or edge cases to verify
#
# 5. Call the testing agent with specific instructions referring to test_result.md
#
# IMPORTANT: Main agent must ALWAYS update test_result.md BEFORE calling the testing agent, as it relies on this file to understand what to test next.

    message: "FEATURES SECTION CODE REVIEW COMPLETED: I've thoroughly reviewed the code for the Features section (About section) and found that it has been completely redesigned as a futuristic cyberpunk dashboard as requested. The implementation includes: (1) Dashboard header with status indicators and system info, (2) Three-column layout with feature navigation on the left, main display in the center, and side panel with system metrics on the right, (3) Interactive feature modules that can be clicked to display different content, (4) Cyberpunk visual effects including scanlines, pulsing status dots, gradient text effects, and animated elements, (5) Action buttons for each feature module. However, I cannot verify the actual rendering and functionality due to the persistent frontend loading issue. The code implementation looks correct and comprehensive, but testing the interactive elements and visual effects is not possible until the frontend rendering issue is resolved."

    message: "ONE-PAGE SCROLL LAYOUT TESTING ATTEMPTED: I've attempted to test the new one-page scroll layout as requested, but I'm still encountering issues with the frontend rendering. The code review shows that the implementation has been changed from a section-switching layout to a one-page scroll experience with all sections stacked vertically. The navigateToSection function has been updated to use scrollIntoView for smooth scrolling to the corresponding section instead of switching pages. The CSS includes proper scroll-margin-top to account for the fixed header. However, I cannot verify the actual functionality due to the persistent frontend rendering issues. The browser automation tool is unable to find the expected elements (.app, .hamburger-menu, #hero, etc.) on the page, suggesting that the React application is not properly rendering in the browser environment."
