## Scrollbar and Styling

- Scroll snap functionality is enabled
- iOS-style momentum scrolling (-webkit-overflow-scrolling: touch) is not implemented

## Touch Target Sizing
- Menu item height: 42px
- Adequate touch targets (â‰¥44px): No (slightly below recommended minimum)
- Spacing between menu items: 10px (provides adequate separation)

## Menu Behavior

## Issues Identified
1. Menu items have a height of 42px, which is slightly below the recommended 44px minimum for touch targets
2. iOS-style momentum scrolling is not implemented, which could affect the smoothness of scrolling on iOS devices

## Recommendations
1. Increase menu item height to at least 44px for better touch targets
2. Implement iOS-style momentum scrolling with -webkit-overflow-scrolling: touch
